# Pre-study assignment FI C++ Summer 2023 task

Write a program that reads a list of numbers from the user and then outputs the following statistics:

- The sum of the integers in the list
- The average of the integers in the list
- The minimum value in the list
- The maximum value in the list
- The most frequent value in the list
- The difference between the the minimum and maximum of the list
- The program should prompt the user to enter the number of integers in the list, followed by the integers themselves.

Optional: You can refactor your program to read the numbers from a text file and output the same report to the user without the need of manually entering values to the program.
